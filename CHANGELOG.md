# Changelog

## 3.2.0 — 2026-07-13

### Added

- Dependency-aware CodeGraph refresh for TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, and JSX.
- File hashes and repository fingerprints for stale graph detection.
- Forward/reverse dependency traversal with test prioritization and graph-path
  explanations.
- `forgeai-init --compile-context` for budgeted AST excerpts with JSON and
  Markdown output.
- Full-node extraction with signature fallback and source-line provenance.
- Mandatory and task-applicable rule packing from `.ai/RULES.md`.
- Deterministic read-only git diagnostics and validation-script discovery in
  compiled context artifacts.

### Changed

- `--context-pack` now requires a valid generated dependency graph and refuses
  stale source evidence.
- The default context selection bound is 12 files at traversal depth 2.

### Migration

Existing installations must run `forgeai-init --upgrade`, then explicitly run
`forgeai-init --refresh-codegraph` before using `--context-pack` or
`--compile-context`. Curated `.ai/codegraph/graph.json` and project-owned state
remain preserved. See `docs/migrations/3.2.0.md`.
